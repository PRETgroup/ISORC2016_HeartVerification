    note = {Invited Paper},
    abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of
              computation and physical processes. Embedded
              computers and networks monitor and control the
              physical processes, usually with feedback loops
              where physical processes affect computations and
              vice versa. The economic and societal potential of
              such systems is vastly greater than what has been
              realized, and major investments are being made
              worldwide to develop the technology. There are
              considerable challenges, particularly because the
              physical components of such systems introduce
              safety and reliability requirements qualitatively
              different from those in general-purpose computing.
              Moreover, physical components are qualitatively
              different from object-oriented software
              components. Standard abstractions based on method
              calls and threads do not work. This paper examines
              the challenges in designing such systems, and in
              particular raises the question of whether today's
              computing and networking technologies provide an
              adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it
              will not be sufficient to improve design
              processes, raise the level of abstraction, or
              verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are
              built on today's abstractions. To realize the full
              potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild
              computing and networking abstractions. These
              abstractions will have to embrace physical
              dynamics and computation in a unified way.},
