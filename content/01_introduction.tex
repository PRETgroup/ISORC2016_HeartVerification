\section{Introduction}

Artificial cardiac pacemakers are embedded devices that 
stimulate the heart with electrical impulses to 
maintain or restore a normal rhythm in people with slow heart rhythms.
These devices continuously monitor a human heart and must operate in a 
fail-safe manner all the time. 
However, in 1990-2000, close to 200,000 pacemakers were 
recalled due to software related failures~\cite{alemzadeh13}.
As the complexity of the pacemakers increase, there is a need for the
development of better processes for validation of such
devices.
