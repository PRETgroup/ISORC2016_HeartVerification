\section{Existing Heart models }
\label{sec:existingHeartModels}

In this section we discuss existing models 
of the heart used for pacemaker verifications.

		{\bf Heart Anatomy} (Figure~\ref{fig:heartNetwork}) 						
		& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Electrical conduction system is modelled as a network of nodes connected by paths} 	 											
		\\ \hline
		{\bf Model of the node} 	
		&	Only captures the timing behaviours i.e., the time spent in each location
		&   Captures both the time and the voltage in each location. This captures the morphology of action potential. 		
		\\ \hline
		{\bf Model of the path} 	
		& Uses events to capture the behaviour of neighbouring cells.
		& Uses continuous values (voltage) to capture the behaviour of neighbouring cells. 	
		\\ \hline
		{\bf Formal verification} 	
		& Can be formally verified using existing TA tools such as UPPAAL.
		& Cannot be formally verified using existing tools.
		\\ \hline
		{\bf \acp{EGM}} 	
		& Due to the abstraction to \ac{TA}, only synthetic \acp{EGM} can be generated
		& Due to the continuous model, realistic  \acp{EGM} can be generated.
		\\ \hline
		{\bf Verification of Pacemaker (Figure~X) }	
		& Closed-loop verification with synthetic \acp{EGM}.
		& Not possible with existing tools.
